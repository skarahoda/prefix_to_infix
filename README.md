prefix_to_infix
===============

A translator is a recursive parser that translates from prefix expresion to infix expresion

The grammar of the source code is G where N = {S, E, tVAR, tNUM, tOP}, Î£ = {+, -, 0-9, a-z, A-Z}, S is the start symbol, and P consists of the following production rules:



S	-> E

E	-> tOP E E | tNUM | tVAR

tNUM	-> [1-9] | tNUM[0-9]

tVAR	-> [a-zA-Z] | tVAR[a-zA-Z0-9]

tOP	-> + | -
