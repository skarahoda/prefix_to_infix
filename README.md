prefix_to_infix
===============

A translator is a recursive parser that translates from prefix expresion to infix expresion

The grammar of the source code is G where N = {S, E, tVAR, tNUM}, Î£ = {+, -, 0-9, a-z, A-Z}, S is the start symbol, and P consists of the following production rules:

S -> E <br/>
E -> + E E | - E E | tNUM | tVAR <br/>
tNUM -> [1-9] | tNUM[0-9] <br/>
tVAR -> [a-zA-Z] | tVAR[a-zA-Z0-9]
